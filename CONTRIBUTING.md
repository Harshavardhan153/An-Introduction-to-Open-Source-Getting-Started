#Contributing to this project

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines to for contributing to a project. Feel free to propose change to this document in a pull request.

## Issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for projects. If you find a bug, or have a suggestion for enhancement, feel free to open an issue. You can open one using the green button "New issue", located in the "Issues" tab or the project.

### What a great issue has

So, what do you need to fill in an issue?
 * Title: The title should describe the bug or enhancement briefly.
 * Labels: Check if the project has labels and add the labels that describes the issue.
 * Summary: Summarize the bug/enhancement concisely.
 * Steps to reproduce (Bugs only): How the developer or others users can reproduce the bug? This is important.
 * Revelant information: Add logs, or screenshots if filling a bug, or maybe a mockup if it's a enhancement.
 * Environment info: Tell the version of software and OS you encountered the issue. 

Tip: Check first if a similar issue hasn't filled before!

## Pull request

Pull requests (PRs) let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

Follow the contribution etiquette of the project located in CONTRIBUTING.md.

In order to create a PR, you can use the white button located in the main page of the project you want to contribute. Note that maybe you need to create a fork first so you can work on the changes before making the PR. [More info here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Your PR should also use a branching strategy, noted down.

### What a great PR has

 * Title: Should describe what the PR does.
 * Summary: A description. You usually should only address one problem per PR.
 * Tags: Use the tags the project have to help the reviewer(s).
 * Issue: What issues are addressed on this PR?
 * Tests: If the project demands tests for new code, be sure to add it. Also, make sure the code builds and pass all the tests, before sending the PR.
 * Don't litter: Follow the coding principles of the project. Squash commits that doesn't add anything by themselves.
 * Wait for feedback: If the reviewer asks for changes, be sure to address them, otherwise, your PR might be closed.

## Branching strategy

Every project follows a branching strategy, that means, some rules on what each branch name means, and how to name them.

One of the most used branching strategy in Github is [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), where you create a branch from the default branch (usually 'master'), put your changes, and the send a PR for discussion. That way, your changes can be reviewed before being accepted.

As a rule of thumb, don't add new changes to 'master', even if the project you are contributing doesn't specify which branching strategy is using.

Happy Open Sourcing!
